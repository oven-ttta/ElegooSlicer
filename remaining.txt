This option can help reducing pillowing on top surfaces in heavily slanted or curved models.

By default, small internal bridges are filtered out and the internal solid infill is printed directly over the sparse infill. This works well in most cases, speeding up printing without too much compromise on top surface quality. 

However, in heavily slanted or curved models especially where too low sparse infill density is used, this may result in curling of the unsupported solid infill, causing pillowing.

Disabling this option will print internal bridge layer over slightly unsupported internal solid infill. The options below control the amount of filtering, i.e. the amount of internal bridges created.

Filter - enable this option. This is the default behavior and works well in most cases.

Limited filtering - creates internal bridges on heavily slanted surfaces, while avoiding creating unnecessary internal bridges. This works well for most difficult models.

No filtering - creates internal bridges on every potential internal overhang. This option is useful for heavily slanted top surface models. However, in most cases it creates too many unnecessary bridges.
<<<SEPARATOR>>>
Print sequence of the internal (inner) and external (outer) walls. 

Use Inner/Outer for best overhangs. This is because the overhanging walls can adhere to a neighbouring perimeter while printing. However, this option results in slightly reduced surface quality as the external perimeter is deformed by being squashed to the internal perimeter.

Use Inner/Outer/Inner for the best external surface finish and dimensional accuracy as the external wall is printed undisturbed from an internal perimeter. However, overhang performance will reduce as there is no internal perimeter to print the external wall against. This option requires a minimum of 3 walls to be effective as it prints the internal walls from the 3rd perimeter onwards first, then the external perimeter and, finally, the first internal perimeter. This option is recommended against the Outer/Inner option in most cases. 

Use Outer/Inner for the same external wall quality and dimensional accuracy benefits of Inner/Outer/Inner option. However, the z seams will appear less consistent as the first extrusion of a new layer starts on a visible surface.

 
<<<SEPARATOR>>>
The direction which the wall loops are extruded when looking down from the top.

By default all walls are extruded in counter-clockwise, unless Reverse on even is enabled. Set this to any option other than Auto will force the wall direction regardless of the Reverse on even.

This option will be disabled if spiral vase mode is enabled.
<<<SEPARATOR>>>
The material may have volumetric change after switching between molten state and crystalline state. This setting changes all extrusion flow of this filament in gcode proportionally. Recommended value range is between 0.95 and 1.05. Maybe you can tune this value to get nice flat surface when there has slight overflow or underflow. 

The final object flow ratio is this value multiplied by the filament flow ratio.
<<<SEPARATOR>>>
With increasing print speeds (and hence increasing volumetric flow through the nozzle) and increasing accelerations, it has been observed that the effective PA value typically decreases. This means that a single PA value is not always 100% optimal for all features and a compromise value is usually used that does not cause too much bulging on features with lower flow speed and accelerations while also not causing gaps on faster features.

This feature aims to address this limitation by modeling the response of your printer's extrusion system depending on the volumetric flow speed and acceleration it is printing at. Internally, it generates a fitted model that can extrapolate the needed pressure advance for any given volumetric flow speed and acceleration, which is then emitted to the printer depending on the current print conditions.

When enabled, the pressure advance value above is overridden. However, a reasonable default value above is strongly recommended to act as a fallback and for when tool changing.


<<<SEPARATOR>>>
If enabled, this setting will ensure external perimeters are not slowed down to meet the minimum layer time. This is particularly helpful in the below scenarios:

 1. To avoid changes in shine when printing glossy filaments 
2. To avoid changes in external wall speed which may create slight wall artifacts that appear like z banding 
3. To avoid printing at speeds which cause VFAs (fine artifacts) on the external walls


<<<SEPARATOR>>>

Note: For Klipper machines, this option is recommended to be disabled. Klipper does not benefit from arc commands as these are split again into line segments by the firmware. This results in a reduction in surface quality as line segments are converted to arcs by the slicer and then back to line segments by the firmware.

Maximum layer height for the combined sparse infill. 

Set it to 0 or 100% to use the nozzle diameter (for maximum reduction in print time) or a value of ~80% to maximize sparse infill strength.

The number of layers over which infill is combined is derived by dividing this value with the layer height and rounded down to the nearest decimal.

Use either absolute mm values (eg. 0.32mm for a 0.4mm nozzle) or % values (eg 80%). This value must not be larger than the nozzle diameter.

Part cooling fan speed may be increased when auto cooling is enabled. This is the maximum speed limitation of part cooling fan
<<<SEPARATOR>>>
The largest printable layer height for extruder. Used tp limits the maximum layer hight when enable adaptive layer height
<<<SEPARATOR>>>
This parameter smooths out sudden extrusion rate changes that happen when the printer transitions from printing a high flow (high speed/larger width) extrusion to a lower flow (lower speed/smaller width) extrusion and vice versa.

It defines the maximum rate by which the extruded volumetric flow in mm3/sec can change over time. Higher values mean higher extrusion rate changes are allowed, resulting in faster speed transitions.

A value of 0 disables the feature. 

For a high speed, high flow direct drive printer (like the Bambu lab or Voron) this value is usually not needed. However it can provide some marginal benefit in certain cases where feature speeds vary greatly. For example, when there are aggressive slowdowns due to overhangs. In these cases a high value of around 300-350mm3/s2 is recommended as this allows for just enough smoothing to assist pressure advance achieve a smoother flow transition.

For slower printers without pressure advance, the value should be set much lower. A value of 10-15mm3/s2 is a good starting point for direct drive extruders and 5-10mm3/s2 for Bowden style. 

This feature is known as Pressure Equalizer in Prusa slicer.

Note: this parameter disables arc fitting.

<<<SEPARATOR>>>
This setting adds an extra wall to every other layer. This way the infill gets wedged vertically between the walls, resulting in stronger prints. 

When this option is enabled, the ensure vertical shell thickness option needs to be disabled. 

Using lightning infill together with this option is not recommended as there is limited infill to anchor the extra perimeters to.

This option causes the inner seams to be shifted backwards based on their depth, forming a zigzag pattern.
<<<SEPARATOR>>>
In order to reduce the visibility of the seam in a closed loop extrusion, the loop is interrupted and shortened by a specified amount.
This amount can be specified in millimeters or as a percentage of the current extruder diameter. The default value for this parameter is 10%.
<<<SEPARATOR>>>
This option sets the threshold angle for applying a conditional scarf joint seam.
If the maximum angle within the perimeter loop exceeds this value (indicating the absence of sharp corners), a scarf joint seam will be used. The default value is 155°.
<<<SEPARATOR>>>
This option determines the overhang threshold for the application of scarf joint seams. If the unsupported portion of the perimeter is less than this threshold, scarf joint seams will be applied. The default threshold is set at 40% of the external wall's width. Due to performance considerations, the degree of overhang is estimated.
<<<SEPARATOR>>>
This option sets the printing speed for scarf joints. It is recommended to print scarf joints at a slow speed (less than 100 mm/s).  It's also advisable to enable 'Extrusion rate smoothing' if the set speed varies significantly from the speed of the outer or inner walls. If the speed specified here is higher than the speed of the outer or inner walls, the printer will default to the slower of the two speeds. When specified as a percentage (e.g., 80%), the speed is calculated based on the respective outer or inner wall speed. The default value is set to 100%.
<<<SEPARATOR>>>
Start height of the scarf.
This amount can be specified in millimeters or as a percentage of the current layer height. The default value for this parameter is 0.

The wipe speed is determined by the speed of the current extrusion role.e.g. if a wipe action is executed immediately following an outer wall extrusion, the speed of the outer wall extrusion will be utilized for the wipe action.
<<<SEPARATOR>>>
To minimize the visibility of the seam in a closed loop extrusion, a small inward movement is executed before the extruder leaves the loop.
<<<SEPARATOR>>>
To minimize visibility of potential overextrusion at the start of an external perimeter when printing with Outer/Inner or Inner/Outer/Inner wall print order, the de-retraction is performed slightly on the inside from the start of the external perimeter. That way any potential over extrusion is hidden from the outside surface. 

This is useful when printing with Outer/Inner or Inner/Outer/Inner wall print order as in these modes it is more likely an external perimeter is printed immediately after a de-retraction move.
<<<SEPARATOR>>>
The wipe speed is determined by the speed setting specified in this configuration.If the value is expressed as a percentage (e.g. 80%), it will be calculated based on the travel speed setting above.The default value for this parameter is 80%

If smooth or traditional mode is selected, a timelapse video will be generated for each print. After each layer is printed, a snapshot is taken with the chamber camera. All of these snapshots are composed into a timelapse video when printing completes. If smooth mode is selected, the toolhead will move to the excess chute after each layer is printed and then take a snapshot. Since the melt filament may leak from the nozzle during the process of taking a snapshot, prime tower is required for smooth mode to wipe nozzle.

<<<SEPARATOR>>>
Enable this option for automated chamber temperature control. This option activates the emitting of an M191 command before the "machine_start_gcode"
 which sets the chamber temperature and waits until it is reached. In addition, it emits an M141 command at the end of the print to turn off the chamber heater, if present. 

This option relies on the firmware supporting the M191 and M141 commands either via macros or natively and is usually used when an active chamber heater is installed.
<<<SEPARATOR>>>
For high-temperature materials like ABS, ASA, PC, and PA, a higher chamber temperature can help suppress or reduce warping and potentially lead to higher interlayer bonding strength. However, at the same time, a higher chamber temperature will reduce the efficiency of air filtration for ABS and ASA. 

For PLA, PETG, TPU, PVA, and other low-temperature materials, this option should be disabled (set to 0) as the chamber temperature should be low to avoid extruder clogging caused by material softening at the heat break.

If enabled, this parameter also sets a gcode variable named chamber_temperature, which can be used to pass the desired chamber temperature to your print start macro, or a heat soak macro like this: PRINT_START (other variables) CHAMBER_TEMP=[chamber_temperature]. This may be useful if your printer does not support M141/M191 commands, or if you desire to handle heat soaking in the print start macro if no active chamber heater is installed.

The maximum print speed when purging in the wipe tower and printing the wipe tower sparse layers. When purging, if the sparse infill speed or calculated speed from the filament max volumetric speed is lower, the lowest will be used instead.

When printing the sparse layers, if the internal perimeter speed or calculated speed from the filament max volumetric speed is lower, the lowest will be used instead.

Increasing this speed may affect the tower's stability as well as increase the force with which the nozzle collides with any blobs that may have formed on the wipe tower.

Before increasing this parameter beyond the default of 90mm/sec, make sure your printer can reliably bridge at the increased speeds and that ooze when tool changing is well controlled.

Please find the details of Flow Dynamics Calibration from our wiki.

Usually the calibration is unnecessary. When you start a single color/material print, with the "flow dynamics calibration" option checked in the print start menu, the printer will follow the old way, calibrate the filament before the print; When you start a multi color/material print, the printer will use the default compensation parameter for the filament during every filament switch which will have a good result in most cases.

Please note that there are a few cases that can make the calibration results unreliable, such as insufficient adhesion on the build plate. Improving adhesion can be achieved by washing the build plate or applying glue. For more information on this topic, please refer to our Wiki.

The calibration results have about 10 percent jitter in our test, which may cause the result not exactly the same in each calibration. We are still investigating the root cause to do improvements with new updates.

In addition, Flow Rate Calibration is crucial for foaming materials like LW-PLA used in RC planes. These materials expand greatly when heated, and calibration provides a useful reference flow rate.
<<<SEPARATOR>>>
Flow Rate Calibration measures the ratio of expected to actual extrusion volumes. The default setting works well in Bambu Lab printers and official filaments as they were pre-calibrated and fine-tuned. For a regular filament, you usually won't need to perform a Flow Rate Calibration unless you still see the listed defects after you have done other calibrations. For more details, please check out the wiki article.

Do you want to rewrite it?
<<<SEPARATOR>>>
The printer preset you created already has a preset with the same name. Do you want to overwrite it?
	Yes: Overwrite the printer preset with the same name, and filament and process presets with the same preset name will be recreated 
and filament and process presets without the same preset name will be reserve.
	Cancel: Do not create a preset, return to the creation interface.
