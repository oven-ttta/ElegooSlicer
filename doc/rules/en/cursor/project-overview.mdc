# ElegooSlicer Project Overview

## Project Introduction

ElegooSlicer is an open-source 3D slicing software based on OrcaSlicer. OrcaSlicer is derived from Bambu Studio, which in turn is based on PrusaSlicer, which originated from Slic3r. The project is written in C++, uses wxWidgets for GUI, and CMake as the build system. The project adopts a modular architecture with core slicing functionality, GUI components, and platform-specific code using separate libraries.

## Tech Stack Overview

- Languages & Standards: C++17 (C++20 features as needed), some Objective-C++ (macOS), Python/Batch/Shell (scripts)
- GUI Framework: wxWidgets 3.2+, combined with ImGui for 3D view rendering
- Rendering: OpenGL (3D preview, model interaction)
- Build System: CMake (minimum 3.13, Windows recommended ≤3.31.x)
- Parallelism & Task Scheduling: Intel TBB, std::thread
- Scripts/Toolchain: Python 3.x, PowerShell/Batch, Shell, gettext
- Dependency Management: `deps/` directory built separately and cached, main project imports via CMake `CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH`

## Core Architecture

libslic3r/ - Core slicing engine and algorithms (platform-independent)
- Main slicing logic, geometry processing, G-code generation
- Core classes: Print, PrintObject, Layer, GCode, Config
- Modular design with specialized subdirectories:
  - `GCode/` - G-code generation, cooling, pressure equalization, thumbnails
  - `Fill/` - Fill pattern implementations (gyroid, honeycomb, lightning infill, etc.)
  - `Support/` - Tree support and traditional support generation
  - `Geometry/` - Advanced geometry operations, Voronoi diagrams, medial axis
  - `Format/` - File I/O (3MF, AMF, STL, OBJ, STEP)
  - `SLA/` - SLA-specific printing processing and support generation
  - `Arachne/` - Advanced wall generation using skeleton trapezoidation

src/slic3r/ - Main application framework and GUI
- GUI application built on wxWidgets
- Integration of libslic3r core with user interface
- Located in `src/slic3r/GUI/`

## Key Algorithm Components

- Arachne Wall Generation: Variable-width perimeter generation using skeleton trapezoidation
- Tree Support: Organic support generation algorithm
- Lightning Infill: Sparse infill optimization for internal structures
- Adaptive Slicing: Variable layer height based on geometry
- Multi-material: Multi-extruder and soluble support handling
- G-code Post-processing: Cooling, fan control, pressure advance, collision checking

## File Format Support

- 3MF/BBS_3MF: Native format with multi-material and metadata extensions
- STL: Standard tessellation language for 3D models
- AMF: Additive manufacturing format with color/material support
- OBJ: Wavefront OBJ with material definitions
- STEP: CAD format supporting precise geometry
- G-code: Output format with extensive post-processing capabilities

## External Dependencies

- imgui: Immediate mode GUI for 3D viewport
- boost: Utility libraries

## File Organization

Resources and Configuration
- `resources/web/` - Web resources for in-app embedded web interface (homepage, guides, printer management, etc.)
- `resources/profiles/` - Printer and material configuration files organized by manufacturer
- `resources/printers/` - Printer-specific configurations and G-code templates
- `resources/images/` - UI icons, logos, calibration images
- `resources/calib/` - Calibration test patterns and data
- `resources/handy_models/` - Built-in test models (benchy, calibration cubes)

Internationalization and Localization
- `localization/i18n/` - Source translation files (.pot, .po)
- `resources/i18n/` - Runtime language resources
- Translations managed via `scripts/run_gettext.sh` / `scripts/run_gettext.bat`

Platform-Specific Code
- `src/libslic3r/Platform.cpp` - Platform abstraction and utilities
- `src/libslic3r/MacUtils.mm` - macOS-specific utilities (Objective-C++)
- Windows-specific build scripts and configuration
- Linux distribution support scripts in `scripts/linux.d/`

Build and Development Tools
- `cmake/modules/` - Custom CMake find modules and utilities
- `scripts/` - Python utilities for configuration file generation and validation
- `tools/` - Windows build tools (gettext utilities)
- `deps/` - External dependency build configuration

## Build System

- Uses CMake (minimum version 3.13, maximum 3.31.x on Windows)
- Main build directory: `build/`
- Dependencies built in: `deps/build/`
- Build process divided into dependency build and main application build
- Windows: Visual Studio 2019/2022 or Ninja
- macOS: Xcode (default) or Ninja (-x parameter)
- Linux: GCC/Clang with Ninja

## Development Workflow

Adding New Print Settings
- Define setting and its bounds and default value in `PrintConfig.cpp`
- Add UI controls in appropriate GUI components
- Update serialization in configuration save/load
- Add tooltips and help text
- Test with different printer configuration files

Modifying Slicing Algorithms
- Core algorithms located in `libslic3r/` subdirectories
- Performance-critical code should be profiled and optimized
- Consider multi-threading impact (TBB integration)
- Verify changes don't break existing configuration files
- Add regression tests appropriately

GUI Development
- GUI code located in `src/slic3r/GUI/`
- Use existing wxWidgets patterns and custom controls
- Support both light and dark themes
- Consider DPI scaling on high-resolution displays
- Maintain cross-platform compatibility

Adding Printer Support
- Create JSON configuration file in `resources/profiles/[manufacturer].json`
- Add printer-specific start/end G-code templates
- Configure build volume, features, and material compatibility
- Thoroughly test with actual hardware when possible
- Follow existing configuration file structure and naming conventions

Performance Considerations
- Slicing Algorithms: CPU-intensive, profile before optimizing
- Memory Usage: Complex models can consume significant memory
- Multi-threading: Extensive use via TBB
- File I/O: Optimized for large 3MF files with embedded textures
- Real-time Preview: Requires efficient mesh processing

## Important Development Notes

Codebase Navigation
- Codebase exceeds 500,000 lines, extensive use of search tools
- Key entry points: `src/ElegooSlicer.cpp` for application startup
- Core slicing: `libslic3r/Print.cpp` orchestrates slicing pipeline
- Configuration: `PrintConfig.cpp` defines all print/printer/material settings

Compatibility and Stability
- Backward Compatibility: Maintain compatibility of project files and configuration files
- Cross-platform: Supporting Windows/macOS/Linux is crucial
- File Formats: Changes require careful version handling
- Configuration Migration: Migration needed when settings change significantly

Quality and Testing
- Regression Testing: Important due to algorithm complexity
- Performance Benchmarks: Help catch performance regressions
- Memory Leaks: Important for long-running GUI applications
- Cross-platform: Testing required before release
