# AI Interaction Rules

## Language
- Respond in Chinese
- Code/comments/commits in English
- Error messages start with lowercase

## Code Modification
User frequently modifies code manually. NEVER use old code from conversation history.

**Use current context first:**
1. User attached/selected code
2. Open files in IDE
3. Recently read files

**When to read_file:** File not in context or uncertain about freshness.

## Principles
- Make changes directly, don't just suggest
- Keep changes minimal and focused
- NO auto-generating tests/docs unless requested
- NO auto-running compilation/testing
- Suggest commands, let user run them
