# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Overview

ElegooSlicer is an open-source 3D slicer application based on OrcaSlicer, developed by ELEGOO with enhanced integration for ELEGOO printers. OrcaSlicer is forked from Bambu Studio, built using C++ with wxWidgets for the GUI and CMake as the build system. The project uses a modular architecture with separate libraries for core slicing functionality, GUI components, and platform-specific code. ElegooSlicer adds custom features including ElegooLink print host integration, printer network management, and Material Management System (MMS) support.

## Architecture

- **CGAL**: Computational Geometry Algorithms Library (selective use)
- **OpenVDB**: Volumetric data structures for advanced operations
- **Eigen**: Linear algebra library for mathematical operations

## File Organization

### Resources and Configuration
- `resources/profiles/` - Printer and material profiles organized by manufacturer
- `resources/printers/` - Printer-specific configurations and G-code templates  
- `resources/images/` - UI icons, logos, calibration images
- `resources/calib/` - Calibration test patterns and data
- `resources/handy_models/` - Built-in test models (benchy, calibration cubes)

### Internationalization and Localization  
- `localization/i18n/` - Source translation files (.pot, .po)
- `resources/i18n/` - Runtime language resources
- Translation managed via `scripts/run_gettext.sh` / `scripts/run_gettext.bat`

### Platform-Specific Code
- `src/libslic3r/Platform.cpp` - Platform abstractions and utilities
- `src/libslic3r/MacUtils.mm` - macOS-specific utilities (Objective-C++)
- Windows-specific build scripts and configurations
- Linux distribution support scripts in `scripts/linux.d/`

### Build and Development Tools
- `cmake/modules/` - Custom CMake find modules and utilities
- `scripts/` - Python utilities for profile generation and validation  
- `tools/` - Windows build tools (gettext utilities)
- `deps/` - External dependency build configurations

## Development Rules

**Detailed rules in `.cursor/rules/`:**
- `ai-interaction.md` - Language, code modification workflow (ALWAYS APPLY)
- `coding-standards.md` - Naming conventions, code style, organization
- `git-workflow.md` - Git rebase workflow, commit message format
- `build-and-test.md` - Build commands, testing guidelines

**Key principles:**
- Work from latest code in context, never old conversation history
- All code/comments in English, no Chinese characters
- Keep changes minimal and focused
- Follow existing patterns in codebase

## Development Workflow

### Common Development Tasks

#### Adding New Print Settings
1. Define setting in `PrintConfig.cpp` with proper bounds and defaults
2. Add UI controls in appropriate GUI components  
3. Update serialization in config save/load
4. Add tooltips and help text for user guidance
5. Test with different printer profiles

#### Modifying Slicing Algorithms  
1. Core algorithms live in `libslic3r/` subdirectories
2. Performance-critical code should be profiled and optimized
3. Consider multi-threading implications (TBB integration)
4. Validate changes don't break existing profiles
5. Add regression tests where appropriate

#### GUI Development
1. GUI code resides in `src/slic3r/GUI/` (not visible in current tree)
2. Use existing wxWidgets patterns and custom controls
3. Support both light and dark themes
4. Consider DPI scaling on high-resolution displays
5. Maintain cross-platform compatibility

#### Adding Printer Support
1. Create JSON profile in `resources/profiles/[manufacturer].json`
2. Add printer-specific start/end G-code templates
3. Configure build volume, capabilities, and material compatibility
4. Test thoroughly with actual hardware when possible
5. Follow existing profile structure and naming conventions

### Dependencies and Build System
- **CMake-based** with separate dependency building phase
- **Dependencies** built once in `deps/build/`, then linked to main application  
- **Cross-platform** considerations important for all changes
- **Resource files** embedded at build time, platform-specific handling

### Performance Considerations
- **Slicing algorithms** are CPU-intensive, profile before optimizing
- **Memory usage** can be substantial with complex models
- **Multi-threading** extensively used via TBB
- **File I/O** optimized for large 3MF files with embedded textures
- **Real-time preview** requires efficient mesh processing

## Important Development Notes

### Codebase Navigation
- Use search tools extensively - codebase has 500k+ lines
- Key entry points: `src/ElegooSlicer.cpp` for application startup
- Core slicing: `libslic3r/Print.cpp` orchestrates the slicing pipeline
- Configuration: `PrintConfig.cpp` defines all print/printer/material settings

### Compatibility and Stability
- **Backward compatibility** maintained for project files and profiles
- **Cross-platform** support essential (Windows/macOS/Linux)  
- **File format** changes require careful version handling
- **Profile migrations** needed when settings change significantly

### Quality and Testing
- **Regression testing** important due to algorithm complexity
- **Performance benchmarks** help catch performance regressions
- **Memory leak** detection important for long-running GUI application
- **Cross-platform** testing required before releases
